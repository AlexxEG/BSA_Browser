### ToDo

- [ ] Detailed view for advanced mode or debug mode
- [ ] Include xtexconv for converting XboxDDS to DDS
- [ ] Look at BSABrowser.ExtractFiles and allow multiple extraction operations at same time (maybe limit to one per archive or actually check indiviual files)
- [ ] Compare tool: Add ability to extract files https://ibb.co/n7Xrscb
- [ ] Compare tool: Async comparing, progress bar

### Complete

- [X] ~~Fix estimated extraction time~~
- [X] ~~Ability to view texture compression type (for example in Title for preview window) https://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?showtopic=4997660/#entry77156298~~
- [X] ~~Fix previewing files without extension using ShellExecuteEx with openas~~
- [X] ~~Extract GNF with .gnf extension instead of .dds so it can be associated with a different program by the OS~~
- [X] ~~Option to match time stamp of extracted files with the archive~~
- [X] ~~Search across all open archives (maybe a 'All' node)~~
- [X] ~~Right click options in Explorer to extract~~
- [X] ~~Compare single files within any archive. Idea: Right click to mark first file, then right click second file to start comparing. Display the filename of first file when selecting the second (\{archive\} - \{filename\})~~
- [X] ~~And/or: Same as above, but second file can be multiple files and they're all compared to the first~~
- [X] ~~Properly handle shutdown when extract operations are active~~
- [X] ~~Compare tool: Toggle overlapping files (only show different files) OR check boxes for each type~~
- [x] Compare tool: Improve sorting
