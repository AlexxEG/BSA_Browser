### ToDo

- [ ] Detailed view for advanced mode or debug mode
- [ ] Compare single files within any archive. Idea: Right click to mark first file, then right click second file to start comparing. Display the filename of first file when selecting the second (\{archive\} - \{filename\})
- [ ] And/or: Same as above, but second file can be multiple files and they're all compared to the first
- [ ] Option to match time stamp of extracted files with the archive

### Complete
